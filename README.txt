Marina Hacks: March 27th, 2021
Authors: Anthony Le, Dylan Huynh, Angelo Ryan Soriano, Ellesia Truong

Project: TIC-TAC-Pain in my Toe
For this hackathon, we created our version of TIC-TAC-TOE using Pygames.
The goal of TIC-TAC-TOE is to make all your symbols match in a row of three, column of three, or a diagonal of three.
The display will show which player's turn it is, the amount of wins each player has, and the game board. 

Installation:
We developed our code using the Pycharm IDE and installing the Pygame libraries. 
You can run our game using the tic tac pain in my toe.exe
